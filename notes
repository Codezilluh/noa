TODO
	
	open up entities.add() to be explicit, reduce inter-component dependency
	THEN generalize for e.g. mobs
	
	Later: need to rework camera to just be a free camera that looksAt() stuff?
	

camera management
	on Render:
		get mouse inputs, set camera rotation, clear mouse inputs


Movement
	entity movement component
		heading, runspeed, stopspeed, jumpHeight, etc.
	input receiving component processor
		set player entity's heading from camera direction
		set isRunning, isJumping, etc. from inputs
	mob AI processor (plays same role as input, but from AI)
		set mob entity heading, isRunning, etc. based on AI rules
	movement processor
		apply forces in direction of heading
		handle world collisions, friction, autostep, etc.
	on RENDER
		update mesh positions to body.position + velocity/dt



Function injection:
	window._ct = 0
	var q = function(x,y,z) { this.x=x, this.y=y, this.z=z; window._ct++ }
	q.prototype = BABYLON.Vector3.prototype
	for (var s in BABYLON.Vector3) { q[s] = BABYLON.Vector3[s] }
	BABYLON.Vector3 = q
